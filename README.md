subDrush (Sublime Drush plugin)
===============================

This is plugin for Sublime Text 3 (ST3) that exposes a subset of [Drush](https://drupal.org/project/drush) functionality to facilitate Drupal development.

### Usage

This plugin works best when you have a Drupal directory open in ST3.

Open up the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P), type `drush` to see the commands.

Feel free to create your own [key bindings](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/key_bindings.html) as none are provided by this plugin.

### Requirements

- Sublime Text 3 (Build 3033 or later)
- Works on MacOS.  Not tested elsewhere.

#### Drush

Use drush via Composer.

#### Drupal

Should work ok with Drupal 7. Not tested with any other versions.

### Installation

Clone this repository into the `Packages` directory - see the [Sublime Text 3 docs](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/packages.html) for more information.

### Credits

The ThreadProgress class is borrowed from [wbond's](https://github.com/wbond) [Sublime Package Control](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control) plugin.
